## Introduction:
This repository contains a comprehensive study and code implementation for predicting stock market trends using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) and RNN-LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory) algorithms. It is a valuable resource for anyone interested in applying machine learning techniques to financial market predictions.

## Contents:
- ML_REPORT_FINAL.pdf: A detailed report on the application of KNN and RNN-LSTM algorithms in stock market prediction, including theoretical background, methodology, and results.
- ML-Project.py: Python script implementing the described machine learning algorithms for stock market prediction.

## Algorithm Details:
- The project explores the use of:

    - KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) for classifying stock market data.
    - RNN-LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory) for analyzing time-series data and predicting future stock market trends.

## Dataset:
- The study utilizes data from the S&P 500 index, available in CSV format. Key attributes include opening and closing prices, highs and lows, and derived features.

## Results and Analysis:
- The report discusses the accuracy and performance of both KNN and RNN-LSTM models, with insights into their effectiveness in stock market prediction.

## Usage Instructions:
- To use the script, clone the repository and run ML-Project.py. Ensure to refer to the PDF document for detailed explanations and results.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
